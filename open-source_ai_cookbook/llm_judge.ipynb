In most cases, COVID-19 causes mild symptoms\\nincluding dry cough, tiredness and fever, though fever may not be a symptom\\nfor some older people. Other mild symptoms include aches and pains, nasal\\ncongestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. Some people become infected\\nbut don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people recover from\\nthe disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people\\nwho gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.   \n",

The answer does provide a list of symptoms associated with Covid-19, but it also includes a lot of information that is not directly related to the question.\\nTotal rating: 3  "
